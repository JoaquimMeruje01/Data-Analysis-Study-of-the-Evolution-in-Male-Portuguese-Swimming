# Data Analysis: Study of the Evolution in Male Portuguese Swimming


This project was developed with the goal of understanding the evolution of Portuguese Swimming from the early 1960s to the present days. To do this, the idea was to compare Portuguese National Records with World Records and American National Records, at the time they were achieved, in order to understand the number of years that Portuguese national records were behind compared to American and World Records. 

This study was carried out for the male gender, for each of the events on the swimming calendar: 50m, 100m, 200m, 400m, 800m and 1500m Freestyle, 50m, 100m and 200m Backstroke, 50m, 100m and 200m Breaststroke, 50m, 100m and 200m Butterfly and 200m and 400m Medley.

In this way, it was possible to understand the evolution of the Portuguese National Records and how they have become increasingly closer to the American and World National Records. In addition, some interesting statistics were obtained, such as the athletes and clubs with the most number of national records, the number of national records broken per event and the differences in relation to the world records for 50m.

All the development was carried out using the Python, via Jupyter Notebooks. Some of the integrated libraries are: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn. In addition, Web Scraping was carried out to obtain the various types from the Wikipedia and USA Swimming websites, as well as Text Extraction from PDFs.
